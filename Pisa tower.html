    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Construction began in 1173 and continued (with long pauses) into the 14th century.</li>
      <li>Built as the campanile (bell tower) for Pisa Cathedral in the Piazza dei Miracoli.</li>
      <li>Famous for its tilt due to unstable subsoil and inadequate foundation; the lean increased during construction.</li>
      <li>Height: about 56 metres on the higher side (roughly 183 feet); it has 8 storeys including the chamber for the bells.</li>
      <li>Stabilisation and restoration efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries reduced the lean and secured the tower for visitors.</li>
      <li>Part of the Piazza dei Miracoli UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of Italyâ€™s most visited landmarks.</li>

      const text = `The Leaning Tower of Pisa began construction in eleven seventy three as the freestanding bell tower for Pisa Cathedral. Built over many decades, the tower developed a pronounced tilt because of soft, unstable ground and a shallow foundation. Rising to about fifty six metres on its higher side, the tower has eight storeys including the bell chamber. Extensive stabilization work in recent decades reduced the lean and made the monument safe for visitors. The tower sits in the Piazza dei Miracoli and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an enduring symbol of medieval Italian architecture.`;
