    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Great Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops) is the largest, built c. 2580â€“2560 BCE during Egyptâ€™s Fourth Dynasty.</li>
      <li>Other main pyramids: Khafre (often appears taller because of its elevated site) and Menkaure (smallest of the three major tomb pyramids).</li>
      <li>The Great Sphinx â€” a limestone statue with a lionâ€™s body and human head â€” is traditionally attributed to Pharaoh Khafre and dates to the same general period.</li>
      <li>Pyramids served as monumental tombs for pharaohs and were part of larger funerary complexes with temples and causeways.</li>
      <li>Constructed from millions of limestone and granite blocks using remarkable ancient engineering methods.</li>
      <li>Giza is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and remains one of the most visited archaeological complexes in the world.</li>

      const text = `The Pyramids of Giza and the Great Sphinx stand on the Giza Plateau near Cairo as some of the finest monuments of ancient Egypt. The Great Pyramid, built for Pharaoh Khufu around twenty six hundred BCE, is the largest; its neighborsâ€”Khafre and Menkaureâ€”form the classic Giza group. The Great Sphinx, carved from the bedrock with a lion's body and human head, is traditionally linked to Khafre. These structures were built as royal tombs and part of elaborate funerary complexes, constructed from millions of stone blocks and demonstrating extraordinary ancient engineering. Giza is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts visitors from around the globe.`;
